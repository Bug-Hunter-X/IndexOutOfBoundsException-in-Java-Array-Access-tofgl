# IndexOutOfBoundsException Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. This exception occurs when an array is accessed using an index that is either negative or greater than or equal to the array's size. 

The `Bug.java` file contains the buggy code, and `BugSolution.java` provides a corrected version.  The solution emphasizes the importance of careful index boundary checks.
